**Francesco Liverano - Private Chef**
I build this project for a Chef Francesco, who wants start a career as Private Chef.
His idea it's simple and clear , Francesco wants to do what he does best directly in his customers kitchen.
 

**UX**
This website is been build for the users that are looking for hiring a Private Chef and creating different atmosphere for their dinner/party at home with friends.

**Features**
This website has 3 pages ,which are home, dishes, and contact us. 
Home(index.html), is a homepage which explains what this is website is for.
Dishes(dishes.html), is a page with images and description of Chef Francesco's dishes.
Contact us (contact.html), is a page which contain a form where users can contact Francesco. 

Also I created a style.css file , used for creating style for the website.

**Features Left to Implement**
All the pages contains a **navbar** which works perfectly on normal screen size but not in small screens.
**Technologies Used**
Languange used are HTML and Css.
Frameworks used is Bootstrap.

**JQuery**
In this project I did not use JQuery.

**Contact form**
The contact form works very welll , and if submit with a empty form it will show you a error messagge about a required field.
It works also in different size screens.

**Deployment**
The hosting platform it's Github.
First I created 3 new file ,which are *index.html*, *dishes.html* and *contact.html*, after that I created inside  **.theia** folder a new folder called **assets** which contains 2 more folder which are *images* and *css*.
Into *css* folder , I created a file named *style.css* which i been using for styling the website. 

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

python3 -m http.server

A blue button should appear to click: Expose,

Another blue button should appear to click: Open Browser.
